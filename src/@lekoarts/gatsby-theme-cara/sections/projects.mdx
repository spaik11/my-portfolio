  This was a collaborative project with my classmate, Nikolay Kim. The app was
  built with the MERN stack and used Google Maps API, along with Socket.io. It
  was a lot of fun working on this project. The app is currently deployed on
  Heroku. The link is provided in the GitHub repo!

  TruZillow was created with my classmate, Paul Garay. We used the MERN stack
  along with React Leaflet and the Bridge Real Estate API to help users find
  properties in certain parts of Texas. It was our first big collaborative
  project using new technologies with a short two week turn around. I enjoyed
  working as a team and delivering a project that encompasses a basic "CRUD"
  app.

  Is it just me or do you find it annoying to translate messages in an app, just
  to copy it to your messenger. I thought why don't we translate messages right
  away based on the users selected language. That is my app. It is built with
  the MERN stack along with Google Translate API and Socket.io

  The library app allows users to select the NY Times current best sellers and
  check them out of the library. The app was built on Express, Node, MongoDB,
  and uses EJS for the front end.
